# DroneCodingTest
I used Visual Studio 2022 to developing the application.
The project was developed with monolithic structure, was not necessary an multitier architecture because of the simplicity of the problem.
Was choosed windows forms (with .Net Framework 4.8) as project type.
Becuase of my personal usage, and to best code reading was used Linq to query the collections.
The data extraction was made using regex.
No external dependences/libraries was used on developing.
The output file will be created on the selected directory as "Output_yyyyMMddHHmmss".
